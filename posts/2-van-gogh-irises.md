### Symbolism and Emotion

*"Irises"* is more than just a floral painting—it's a window into Van Gogh's soul. The work was created during a time when the artist was battling severe mental health issues, and many art historians believe that the flowers represent both **hope** and **fragility**.

- **Hope**: The irises represent a sense of life and vibrancy, emerging against a backdrop of turmoil.
- **Fragility**: The flowers themselves are delicate, symbolizing the artist's internal battle with his own mental state.

Van Gogh was known to see nature as a reflection of his inner world, and his depiction of the irises can be seen as a metaphor for his own psychological state: vibrant yet fragile.
