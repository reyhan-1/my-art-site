I love the simplicity, imperfection and vulnerability in Nazim Hikmet's poems. 
It used to be only when I felt I was in love, recently I try to take a pause to really look, feel, see... 
Taking time to notice things made me realize I didn't know I loved some things. 
Or remembered what I have forgotten I loved. </span>

*Things I Didn't Know I Loved*     
it's 1962 March 28th    
I'm sitting by the window on the Prague-Berlin train    
night is falling    
I never knew I liked    
night descending like a tired bird on a smoky wet plain     
I don't like    
comparing nightfall to a tired bird     

I didn't know I loved the earth     
can someone who hasn't worked the earth love it     
I've never worked the earth     
it must be my only Platonic love    

and here I've loved rivers all this time    
whether motionless like this they curl skirting the hills   
European hills crowned with chateaus    
or whether stretched out flat as far as the eye can see     
I know you can't wash in the same river even once   
I know the river will bring new lights you'll never see     
I know we live slightly longer than a horse but not nearly as long as a crow    
I know this has troubled people before      
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">and will trouble those after me</span>  
I know all this has been said a thousand times before  
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">and will be said after me</span>  

I didn't know I loved the sky   
cloudy or clear     
the blue vault Andrei studied on his back at Borodino   
in prison I translated both volumes of War and Peace into Turkish   
I hear voices   
not from the blue vault but from the yard   
the guards are beating someone again    
I didn't know I loved trees     
bare beeches near Moscow in Peredelkino     
they come upon me in winter noble and modest    
beeches are Russian the way poplars are Turkish     
"the poplars of Izmir   
losing their leaves. . .    
they call me The Knife. . .     
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">lover like a young tree. . .</span>  
I blow stately mansions sky-high"       
in the Ilgaz woods in 1920 I tied an embroidered linen handkerchief     
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">to a pine bough for luck</span>  

I never knew I loved roads      
even the asphalt kind       
Vera's behind the wheel we're driving from Moscow to the Crimea     
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">Koktebele</span>         
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;"> formerly "Goktepé ili" in Turkish </span>
the two of us inside a closed box       
the world flows past on both sides distant and mute     
I was never so close to anyone in my life   
bandits stopped me on the red road between Bolu and Geredé      
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">when I was eighteen</span>   
apart from my life I didn't have anything in the wagon they could take  
and at eighteen our lives are what we value least   
I've written this somewhere before      
wading through a dark muddy street I'm going to the shadow play     
Ramazan night   
a paper lantern leading the way         
maybe nothing like this ever happened       
maybe I read it somewhere an eight-year-old boy         
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">going to the shadow play</span>      
Ramazan night in Istanbul holding his grandfather's hand    
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">his grandfather has on a fez and is wearing the fur coat</span> 
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">with a sable collar over his robe</span>    
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">and there's a lantern in the servant's hand</span>   
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">and I can't contain myself for joy   </span>    
flowers come to mind for some reason    
poppies cactuses jonquils   
in the jonquil garden in Kadikoy Istanbul I kissed Marika   
fresh almonds on her breath 
I was seventeen 
my heart on a swing touched the sky 
I didn't know I loved flowers   
friends sent me three red carnations in prison  

I just remembered the stars 
I love them too 
whether I'm floored watching them from below    
or whether I'm flying at their side 

I have some questions for the cosmonauts    
were the stars much bigger      
did they look like huge jewels on black velvet  
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">or apricots on orange   </span>
did you feel proud to get closer to the stars   
I saw color photos of the cosmos in Ogonek magazine now don't   
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">be upset comrades but nonfigurative shall we say or abstract  </span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">well some of them looked just like such paintings which is to   </span>    
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">say they were terribly figurative and concrete  </span>    
my heart was in my mouth looking at them    
they are our endless desire to grasp things     
seeing them I could even think of death and not feel at all sad     
I never knew I loved the cosmos     

snow flashes in front of my eyes        
both heavy wet steady snow and the dry whirling kind        
I didn't know I liked snow      

I never knew I loved the sun        
even when setting cherry-red as now     
in Istanbul too it sometimes sets in postcard colors        
but you aren't about to paint it that way       
I didn't know I loved the sea       
<span style="margin-left: 2em; display: inline-block;">except the Sea of Azov      </span>  
or how much     

I didn't know I loved clouds        
whether I'm under or up above them      
whether they look like giants or shaggy white beasts        

moonlight the falsest the most languid the most petit-bourgeois     
strikes me      
I like it       

I didn't know I liked rain      
whether it falls like a fine net or splatters against the glass my      
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">heart leaves me tangled up in a net or trapped inside a drop</span>     
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">and takes off for uncharted countries I didn't know I loved </span>        
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">rain but why did I suddenly discover all these passions sitting </span>    
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">by the window on the Prague-Berlin train  </span>        
is it because I lit my sixth cigarette      
one alone could kill me     
is it because I'm half dead from thinking about someone back in Moscow      
her hair straw-blond eyelashes blue     

the train plunges on through the pitch-black night      
I never knew I liked the night pitch-black      
sparks fly from the engine      
I didn't know I loved sparks        
I didn't know I loved so many things and I had to wait until sixty      
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">to find it out sitting by the window on the Prague-Berlin train   </span>    
<span style="margin-left: 1em; display: inline-block;">watching the world disappear as if on a journey of no return     </span>
